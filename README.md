# q

A custom CLI tool for GitHub Copilot Chat.

Uses GitHub Copilot Chat's API, which is not officially documented or supported by GitHub.

It's called `q` because it's the first key on the keyboard and quick to type.

This initially started as reverse engineering the GitHub Copilot Chat API to create a CLI tool that allows you to interact with it in a more convenient way. Parts of the tool are opinionated but it is designed to be flexible and extensible.

_An active GitHub Copilot subscription is required to use this tool._

_Note: Currently developed with a business GitHub Copilot subscription, so it may not work with personal subscriptions._
